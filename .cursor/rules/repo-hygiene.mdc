# Repo Hygiene

## Principle
A repo should only contain what's needed to build and understand the project. Everything else is noise.

## Rules

**Root level** = README, LICENSE, configs only. Everything else goes in folders.

**Before committing any file, ask:**
1. Is this generated? → .gitignore
2. Contains secrets? → .gitignore immediately  
3. One-off/personal? → don't commit
4. Would a new dev need this? → if no, don't commit

**After deleting code:** check for orphans (empty folders, dead imports, unused files).

**If root gets cluttered:** stop and clean before continuing.
